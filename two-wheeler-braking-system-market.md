<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Two-wheeler Braking System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>ABS Braking System</li><li>CBS Braking System</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The two-wheeler braking system market predominantly features two main types: Antilock Braking System (ABS) and Combined Braking System (CBS). ABS enhances safety by preventing wheel lock-up during hard braking, allowing better control and reduced stopping distances. CBS, on the other hand, integrates both front and rear brakes to distribute braking force evenly, improving stability and reducing stopping distance. Both systems aim to enhance rider safety and vehicle handling, driving their adoption in modern two-wheelers.</p></p>
