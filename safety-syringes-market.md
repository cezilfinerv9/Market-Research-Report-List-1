<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Safety Syringes Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Retractable</li><li>Non Retractable</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The safety syringes market is categorized into two main types: retractable and non-retractable syringes. Retractable syringes feature a mechanism that allows the needle to be withdrawn into the barrel after use, minimizing the risk of needlestick injuries and contamination. Non-retractable syringes, on the other hand, do not have this feature, leaving the needle exposed post-use. Both types aim to enhance safety in medical environments, with retractable syringes often favored for their additional protection against accidental needle exposure.</p></p>
